## Deploying a Validator Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a validator on the network and perform various tasks related to staking, registration, and validation.

### Step 1: Registering a Validator

To register a validator with a specific tag, use the following CLI command:

```bash
c vali register tag=whadup
or
c register vali::whadup
```

```python
c.module('vali').register(tag='whadup')
```

This creates a key with "vali::whadup".

You can also serve it and register it with the following commands:

```bash
  c serve vali::whadup
  c register vali::whadup
```

### Step 2: Staking Your Validator

Ensure that you have staked your validator by following these steps:

1. Stake your validator with another key using the CLI command:

   ```bash
   c stake {keywithbalance} vali::whadup {amount}
   ```

   The default amount to be staked is your entire balance. If you don't have a balance, you'll need to unstake.

2. If needed, you can unstake by using the following command:

   ```bash
   c unstake {keywithnobalance} {amount}
   ```
