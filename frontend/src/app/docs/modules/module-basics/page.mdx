# Module Basics

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use the `commune` library for module management in Python. The `commune` library provides functionalities for managing and serving code modules easily.

## Finding Your Module

You can use the following steps to find and work with modules using the `commune` library.

### List All Modules

You can list all available modules using the following code:

```python
import commune as c

modules_list = c.modules()[:10]
c.print(modules_list)
```

### Searching for a Specific Module

To search for a specific module, you can use the `c.modules()` function with a search query:

```python
search_queries = ['model.llama', 'data', 'demo', 'hf']
for query in search_queries:
    c.print(f'Searching for {query}')
    c.print(c.modules(query))
```

## Module Management

Once you've found your module, you can manage it using the following steps.

### Accessing a Module

You can access a module using the `c.module()` function:

```python
demo = c.module('demo')
c.print('## Code for demo module')
c.print(demo.code())
```

### Viewing Module Config

You can view the configuration of a module using the `config()` method:

```python
demo.config()
```

### Listing Module Functions

To list the functions of a module, use the `fns()` method:

```python
demo_functions = demo.fns()
c.print(demo_functions)
```

### Searching for a Function

To search for a specific function within a module, use the `fns()` method with a search query:

```python
function_search_query = 'bro'
matching_functions = demo.fns(function_search_query)
c.print(matching_functions)
```

### Getting Function Schema

You can retrieve the schema of a specific function using the `schema()` method:

```python
function_name = 'bro'
function_schema = demo.schema(function_name)
c.print(function_schema)
```

---

## Serving

You can serve a module to make its functions accessible via a server.

### Serving a Module

You can serve a module using the `serve()` method, optionally providing a tag for versioning:

```python
demo.serve(tag='tag1')
```

### Viewing Available Servers

You can view the available servers using the `servers()` method:

```python
c.print(c.servers())
```

### Viewing Server Logs

To view the logs of a served module, you can use the `logs()` method:

```python
logs = c.logs('demo::tag1', mode='local')
c.print(logs)
```

### Connecting to a Served Module

You can connect to a served module using the `connect()` method:

```python
demo_client = c.connect('demo::tag1')
demo_client.info()
```

### Restarting and Killing a Served Module

You can restart or kill a served module using the `restart()` and `kill()` methods:

```python
c.restart('demo::tag1')  # Restart the module
c.kill('demo::tag1')     # Kill the module
```

This concludes our tutorial on module management using the `commune` library. You've learned how to find modules, manage their functions, serve them, and interact with served modules. This library can greatly simplify the process of managing and deploying code modules in your projects.
