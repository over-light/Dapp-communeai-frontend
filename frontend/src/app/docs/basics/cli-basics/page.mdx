# The PyParse CLI

We have a pythonic cli for commune, which is a wrapper around the `c.Module` library. This is a simple way to interact with the commune library. This does not need to be formated like argparse, and is more like a pythonic cli, where you can test out the functions and modules.

The template for the cli is as follows:

```bash
c {module_name} {function_name} *args **kwargs
```

For example, the following command:

```python
import commune as c
c.modules("model")
```

is the same as

```bash
c modules model
```

## Using the cli to interact with your modules

You can use the cli to interact with your modules. For example, if you have a module called `demo`, you can use the cli to interact with it.

For instance, to get the config of the model.openai module, you can use the following command:

```bash
c model.openai config
```

This is the same as the following python code:

```python
import commune as c
c.module("model.openai").config()
```

## Serving

You can also serve your modules using the cli. For example, if you have a module called `demo`, you can serve it using the following command:

```bash
c demo serve tag=latest
```

This is the same as the following python code:

```python
import commune as c
c.module("demo").serve(tag="latest")
```

## Why did we make this instead of using Argparse?

Argparse is a great library, but it is not very pythonic, and it is not very easy to use. You also have to write a lot of boilerplate code to get it to work, which is not very fun.

Our New Pyparse It is a simple way to interact with the commune library. This does not need to be formated like argparse, and is more like a pythonic cli, where you can test out the functions and modules.
