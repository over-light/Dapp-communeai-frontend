# Key Management

In this tutorial, we'll explore the usage of the `commune` Python package for managing keys, balances, stakes, and key statistics.

## Getting Started

First, you need to import the `commune` module:

```python
import commune as c
```
````

## Listing Keys

To start, let's list all the available keys using the `keys()` function:

```python
c.keys()
```

## Adding and Removing Keys

You can add and remove keys with the following steps:

### Adding a New Key

To add a new key, use the `add_key()` function:

```python
c.add_key('fam')
```

### Removing a Key

To remove a key, use the `rm_key()` function:

```python
c.rm_key('demo')  # Replace 'demo' with the key you want to remove
```

## Saving and Loading Keys

You can save and load keys for future use:

### Saving Keys

To save the keys, use the `save_keys()` function:

```python
c.save_keys()
```

### Loading Keys

To load the saved keys, use the `load_keys()` function:

```python
c.load_keys()
```

## Retrieving Balances and Stakes

You can retrieve balance and stake information for a specific key:

### Balance

To get the balance for a key, use the `get_balance()` function:

```python
c.get_balance('fam')  # Replace 'fam' with the key name
```

### Stake

To get the stake for a key, use the `get_stake()` function:

```python
c.get_stake('fam')  # Replace 'fam' with the key name
```

## Retrieving Key Statistics

You can also retrieve key statistics for each subnet associated with a key:

```python
c.key_stats('fam')  # Replace 'fam' with the key name
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use the `commune` Python package to manage keys, balances, stakes, and key statistics. Feel free to explore further and adapt these concepts to your specific use cases.
