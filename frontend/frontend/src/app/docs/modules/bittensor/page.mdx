## Config

The configuration specifies default variables like the blockchain chain, netuid, available neurons for mining, and more.

```python
import commune as c
bt = c.m('bittensor')

c.print(bt.config) # Config is in Munch format
```

---

## Checking Wallets

You can check the status of different wallet keys: total, registered, and unregistered.

```python
c.print({
    'total_keys': bt.keys(),
    'registered': bt.reged(),
    'unregistered': bt.unreged()
})
```

---

## Mining

Mining involves participating in the Bittensor network as a neuron to contribute and earn rewards.

```python
c.print('The default netuid is', bt.default_netuid)

# Mine with an unregistered neuron
unreged = bt.unreged()
c.print('Mining with', unreged[0])
bt.mine(unreged[0])
```

---

## Talking to the Network

Interact with the Bittensor network by communicating with registered neurons through talking.

```python
# Talk to the network by sampling one of your registered keys
bt.talk('What is the province of Canada?', n=10, timeout=5)
```
