Clone this repo, install the dependencies (all locally), and run the development server (which auto-watches the
files for changes):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smart-window/com-chat.git
cd com-chat
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`. Development builds have the advantage of not requiring
a build step, but can be slower than production builds. Also, development builds won't have timeout on edge functions.
